A little background on me that will hopefully give this entire blog more context.  Currently Iâ€™m a small business owner and entrepreneur with dreams of turning my small business into a big business one day.  Previously, I have been, a student, an athlete, a film maker, a frat boy, a talent agent, a cab driver, a kindergarten teacher, and so much more.

I have been playing around with computers since I was a kid, I dabbled in some QBasic here, some C++ there, but never became a full-fledged programmer until more recently. I have been using excel to model systems for countless years and in many ways have pushed it about as far as it will go.  In 2014 and 2015, after a long hiatus away from software development, I registered a github account and started playing around again, brushing up on my outdated ideas of HTML and CSS. I read that Ruby on rails developers were making good money, and so I tried to set up my first blog built with Ruby on Rails. I took a few online courses but ultimately never did much with ruby on rails.
